- Agent burnout from handling unsuitable cases

**Show**: Statistics slide or dashboard showing poor metrics

### 3. Our Solution - AI-Powered Intelligence (90 seconds)

#### A. Advanced ML Model
**"We built a transformer-enhanced machine learning model that achieves 86.3% accuracy by analyzing:"**
- Customer sentiment using RoBERTa
- Text embeddings with sentence transformers
- 22 engineered features including agent expertise matching
- Real-world Banking77 dataset with 20,000+ interactions

**Show**: Settings page with live model performance metrics

#### B. Real-Time Dashboard
**"Our dashboard provides instant visibility into:"**
- Live customer queue with sentiment analysis
- Agent pool with specialties and workload
- AI routing results with confidence scores
- Performance analytics and system health

**Show**: Main dashboard with live data, demonstrate auto-routing

### 4. Live Demo (2-3 minutes)

#### Step 1: Show Current State
- **Navigate to dashboard**: "Here we have 4 customers waiting and 5 agents available"
- **Point out details**: "Notice the sentiment indicators, agent specialties, and workload distribution"

#### Step 2: Demonstrate AI Routing
- **Click "Auto Route"**: "Watch as our AI analyzes each customer-agent pair and makes optimal matches"
- **Explain results**: "The system matched customers based on sentiment, expertise, and workload - see the routing scores"
- **Show reasoning**: "Each match includes AI reasoning explaining why this pairing was chosen"

#### Step 3: Show AI Management
- **Open Settings**: "Our system includes live AI model management"
- **Show performance metrics**: "Real-time accuracy, AUC scores, and training statistics"
- **Demonstrate retraining**: "Supervisors can retrain the model with new data instantly"

#### Step 4: Reset and Regenerate
- **Click "Reset Queue"**: "The system dynamically generates new realistic scenarios"
- **Show new data**: "Fresh customers and agents with varied profiles for continuous testing"

### 5. Technical Innovation Highlights (60 seconds)

**"What makes our solution unique:"**

#### Advanced AI Architecture
- **Hybrid Model**: "We combine transformer embeddings with XGBoost for optimal performance"
- **Real-World Data**: "Trained on actual banking customer queries, not just synthetic data"
- **Live Learning**: "The model can retrain itself with new data in real-time"

#### Modern Tech Stack
- **Backend**: "FastAPI with async processing for sub-200ms response times"
- **Frontend**: "React with 3D visualizations and smooth animations"
- **Deployment**: "Docker-ready with production configurations"

**Show**: Code architecture or technical diagram

### 6. Business Impact (45 seconds)

**"The results speak for themselves:"**
- **86.3% routing accuracy** vs 60% with traditional methods
- **45ms average response time** for AI predictions
- **Reduced wait times** through intelligent load balancing
- **Improved agent satisfaction** by matching expertise to problems
- **Real-time adaptability** to changing conditions

**Show**: Analytics dashboard with performance metrics

### 7. Closing & Future Vision (30 seconds)
